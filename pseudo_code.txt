# UMPIRE Problem-Solving Worksheet

**Problem Name:** ________________  **Date:** ________________

---

## U - UNDERSTAND
[Restate the problem in your own words, identify inputs/outputs, constraints, and edge cases]

**Inputs:** [type and description]
**Outputs:** [type and description]
**Constraints:** [list all rules and limitations]
**Edge Cases:** [what could go wrong? boundary conditions?]

---

## M - MATCH
[What similar problems have you solved? What data structures and techniques apply?]

**Similar Problems:**
**Data Structures:** [lists, dicts, strings, sets?]
**Patterns/Techniques:** [iteration, validation, string methods, filtering?]

---

## P - PLAN
[Write pseudocode and create test cases BEFORE coding]

**Pseudocode:**
```
function_name(parameters):
    1. [step]
    2. [step]
    return result
```

**Test Cases:**
```
Test 1 (normal): input → expected output
Test 2 (edge):   input → expected output
Test 3 (error):  input → expected output
```

---

## I - IMPLEMENT
[Write your actual Python code with type hints and docstring]

```python
def function_name(param: type) -> return_type:
    """[Description]

    Args:
        param: [description]

    Returns:
        [description]
    """
    pass
```

---

## R - REVIEW
[Test your code, find bugs, verify edge cases]

**Test Results:** [which tests passed/failed?]
**Bugs Fixed:** [what bugs did you find and fix?]
**Quality Check:** [type hints? docstring? clear names? no magic numbers?]

---

## E - EVALUATE
[Analyze time/space complexity and possible improvements]

**Time Complexity:** O(___) because [explanation]
**Space Complexity:** O(___) because [explanation]
**Improvements:** [could you optimize further?]
**Learned:** [what did you learn from this problem?]
